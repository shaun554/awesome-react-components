To add a component / library, add an entry at [devarchy.com/react-components](http://devarchy.com/react-components).
<br/>
It will be added to the catalog once enough users have approved it.

If a component / library doesn't fit any category, then create an issue.

Also create an issue if you would like to suggest improvements to the categorization.
